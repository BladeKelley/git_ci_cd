# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on pull requests that have been closed for the "main" branch
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]
    types:
      - closed

# Create variables the flow can use
env:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # Ensures we are only running when merge has occurred
  build:
    if: github.event.pull_request.merged == true
    # create a docker container using ubuntu 18.04 base from Docker Hub
    container: 
      image: ubuntu:18.04
    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      # Runs the setup script
